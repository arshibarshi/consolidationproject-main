# Tuple Out Game - Ademir Ferreyra

- Hello and welcome to my tuple out game. In this game, you will play a simple 2-player dice game that simulates rolling dice. You will take turns with your other plater and the first to reach the target score, wins.

#Setup
- Start with opening the program, open your terminal (or command in windows) and look for your file, you can do this by changing your directory (using command "cd"). 

- If you can't remember what is in your directory, use command "ls" to see what the terminal finds in it.

- After you make it to your directory, use the command "python" (assuming you have python base conda installed) and type in the python file "consolidation_project.py" on your computer to start my program!

# How to play

- Whoever scores 5 points first wins

- Players have to roll three dice. If all 3 dice show the same number, the player "Tuples oue" and scores zero points! And if two dice roll the same number, then they are fixed and cannot be rerolled.

- Players can reroll a non-fixed dice as many times as they want

- When a player chooses to stop rolling, their turn ends, and the score for the turn will be the sum of the three dice

- If  s player "Tuples out" at any given time, their score for that turn will be zero
